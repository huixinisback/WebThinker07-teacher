# 🗂️ Project Folder Structure & File Explanation

This project folder is organized for effective **project-based learning** using scaffolded files.

---

## 📁 File Naming Conventions
- All files not in the teacher solution are **used by students** during lessons.
- Inside each file, you’ll find **activity prompts** such as:

```
  // Activity: Move left while holding LEFT key
  // Activity: Move up when SPACE is pressed
  // Challenge: Return to centre when keys are released.
```

### `P` Files – **Project Scaffolds**

Files beginning with **`P`** (e.g., `P01.js`, `P02.js`) are **broken-up parts** of the main project.

* Students write their code only in the marked activity areas.

* Once working, they can copy and paste their code into the main project file to assemble the full solution.

* These files double as test beds and guided worksheets.

### L Files – **Learning & Enrichment***
Files beginning with L (e.g., L01.js, L02.js) are optional learning labs or experimentation demos.

They contain self-contained examples that explore concepts not directly required for the project, but essential to understanding how things work.
